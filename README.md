# My Jira - Personal Task Manager

A personal and interactive web application for managing and visualizing your assigned Jira tasks, designed for a responsive, easy-to-use experience. This application connects to the Jira Cloud API via a secure Node.js proxy server.

> **AI-Generated Repository**
>
> **This entire repository, including all code, documentation, and project structure, was generated through collaboration with multiple AI language models including Gemini (Google), Claude (Anthropic) and ChatGPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google)** The development process was iterative and driven by a series of conversational prompts to build features, design the UI, and structure the application. No single line of code was written manually - everything was generated through AI assistance.

## üéØ Who Is This For?

This guide is written for **Lineman Wongnai team members** who have never:
- Written code before
- Used Terminal

## üöÄ Complete Setup Guide for Mac Users

### Prerequisites

You'll need:
1. A Mac computer
2. Your Jira account email and password
3. About 30 minutes for the initial setup

### Step 1: Open Terminal

Terminal is a program on your Mac that lets you control your computer with text commands.

1. Press `Command + Space` on your keyboard
2. Type: **Terminal**
3. Press `Enter`
4. A white or black window will appear - this is Terminal

**Important**: Keep this Terminal window open throughout the entire setup process.

### Step 2: Install Homebrew

Homebrew is a tool that makes it easy to install other programs on your Mac.

1. Copy this entire command (triple-click to select all):
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Paste it into Terminal (Command + V)
3. Press `Enter`
4. **It will ask for your Mac password** - type it and press Enter
   - Note: You won't see any characters while typing your password - this is normal!
5. Wait... this might take 5-10 minutes
6. When it's done, you'll see "Installation successful!"

**Troubleshooting Homebrew Installation:**
- If you see "Command Line Tools for Xcode" popup, click "Install" and wait
- If it says Homebrew is already installed, that's fine! Continue to the next step

### Step 3: Install Required Programs

Now we'll install Node.js and Git using Homebrew.

1. Copy and paste this command:
```bash
brew install node git
```

2. Press `Enter`
3. Wait for it to finish (2-5 minutes)

To verify everything installed correctly, run these commands one by one:
```bash
node --version
```
(Should show something like `v20.10.0`)

```bash
git --version
```
(Should show something like `git version 2.39.0`)

### Step 4: Create a Folder for Your Projects

Let's create a special folder on your Desktop for this app:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
mkdir MyProjects
cd MyProjects
```

### Step 5: Download the Project

Copy and paste this command (replace `<repository-url>` with the actual URL from GitHub):
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
```

For example:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/my-jira-tasks.git
```

Then enter the project folder:
```bash
cd my-jira-tasks
```

### Step 6: Install Project Dependencies

This downloads all the helper programs the app needs:

```bash
npm install
```

Wait for it to finish (this might take 3-5 minutes and show a lot of text - that's normal!)

**Note**: The project uses @dnd-kit for drag-and-drop functionality, which is already included in package.json.

### Step 7: Get Your Jira API Token

1. Keep Terminal open, but switch to your web browser
2. Go to this website: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens
3. Log in with your **Lineman Wongnai Jira account** (your work email and password)
4. Click the blue **"Create API token"** button
5. Name it: **My Jira Tasks**
6. Click **"Create"**
7. **IMPORTANT**: Click "Copy" to copy the token
8. Open TextEdit (Command + Space, type TextEdit, press Enter)
9. Paste the token there temporarily so you don't lose it

### Step 8: Create Your Configuration File (.env)

You can create this file using either Terminal OR Finder. Choose the method you're most comfortable with:

#### Option A: Using Terminal (Recommended)
```bash
nano .env
```

Type exactly this (replace with your actual values):
```
JIRA_EMAIL=your.email@company.com
JIRA_TOKEN=paste_your_token_here
```

Save and exit:
- Press `Control + X`
- Press `Y` to confirm
- Press `Enter`

#### Option B: Using Finder (Visual Method)
1. Open Finder
2. Navigate to: Desktop ‚Üí MyProjects ‚Üí my-jira-tasks
3. Open TextEdit (Command + Space, type TextEdit)
4. Click Format menu ‚Üí Make Plain Text
5. Type exactly this (replace with your values):
   ```
   JIRA_EMAIL=your.email@company.com
   JIRA_TOKEN=paste_your_token_here
   ```
6. Save the file:
   - Press Command + S
   - Navigate to your project folder
   - **IMPORTANT**: Name it exactly `.env` (with the dot)
   - If macOS warns about the dot, click "Use ."
   - Make sure "Hide Extension" is unchecked

### Step 9: Verify the Server File

The project already includes a `server.js` file that's pre-configured to work with Lineman Wongnai's Jira instance. You can verify it exists:

```bash
ls server.js
```

You should see `server.js` listed. This file is already set up to:
- Connect to `https://linemanwongnai.atlassian.net`
- Use your credentials from the `.env` file
- Handle all API requests securely

**Note**: If you're using a different Jira instance (not Lineman Wongnai), you'll need to edit the server.js file:

#### To Edit for Different Jira Domain (Optional):
```bash
nano server.js
```

Find this line:
```javascript
const jiraUrl = `https://linemanwongnai.atlassian.net${jiraPath}`;
```

Change `linemanwongnai` to your company's Jira subdomain.

Save with Control + X, Y, Enter.

### Step 10: Create Start Script

Let's create an easy way to start the app:

1. In Terminal:
```bash
nano start-app.sh
```

2. Paste this:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Starting My Jira Tasks App..."
echo "Starting backend server..."
node server.js &
SERVER_PID=$!
echo "Backend server started with PID $SERVER_PID"
echo "Starting frontend app..."
npm start
echo "Shutting down backend server..."
kill $SERVER_PID
```

3. Save (Control + X, Y, Enter)

4. Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x start-app.sh
```

### Step 11: Start the Application

Run the app:
```bash
./start-app.sh
```

Your browser should open automatically after about 30 seconds!

### Step 12: Configure the App

1. In the web browser, look for the ‚öôÔ∏è (gear) icon in the left sidebar
2. Click it
3. Enter your **Project Key** (e.g., `PROJ`, `BUSINT`, `LMW`)
   - This is the letters before the dash in tickets (e.g., LMW-123 ‚Üí LMW)
4. Click "Save & Close"

**Note**: The app is pre-configured for Lineman Wongnai's Jira (`linemanwongnai.atlassian.net`). If you're using a different Jira instance, you'll need to modify the server.js file as described in Step 9.

## üéâ You're Done!

Your Jira tasks should now appear in the app!

## üÜò Common Problems and Solutions

### "Command not found" Error
```bash
echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```bash
sudo npm install
```

### No Tasks Showing Up
1. Check your Project Key is correct (case-sensitive!)
2. Verify you have tasks assigned to you in Jira
3. Check your .env file has correct email and token:
```bash
cat .env
```

### Port Already in Use Error
Kill all Node processes:
```bash
killall node
```

### App Won't Start
1. Delete node_modules and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

### Lost Your API Token
