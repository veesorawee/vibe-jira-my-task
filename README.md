# My Jira - Personal Task Manager

A personal and interactive web application for managing and visualizing your assigned Jira tasks, designed for a responsive, easy-to-use experience. This application connects to the Jira Cloud API via a secure Node.js proxy server.

> **AI-Generated Repository**
>
> **This entire repository, including all code, documentation, and project structure, was generated by a large language model from Google.** The development process was iterative and driven by a series of conversational prompts to build features, design the UI, and structure the application.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (v14.x or later)
  - `npm` or `yarn`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd my-jira-tasks
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Setup the Backend Proxy:**
    This project requires a Node.js proxy server to securely handle requests to the Jira API.

      - Create a `.env` file in the project's root directory.

      - Add the following environment variables to the `.env` file:

        ```env
        # Your Atlassian account email address
        JIRA_EMAIL=your-email@example.com

        # Your Jira API Token
        JIRA_TOKEN=your_jira_api_token_here
        ```

      - To get your `JIRA_API_TOKEN`, go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens), click "Create API token," give it a label, and copy the generated token.

4.  **Running the Application:**
    You will need to run two processes in two separate terminal windows.

      - **Terminal 1: Start the Proxy Server**

        ```sh
        node server.js
        # The server will start on http://localhost:4000
        ```

      - **Terminal 2: Start the React App**

        ```sh
        npm start
        # The React app will start on http://localhost:3000
        ```

5.  **Open the Dashboard:**
    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

### In-App Configuration

Once the application is running, you need to configure it to point to your Jira project.

1.  Click the **Config** (gear icon) button in the sidebar.
2.  In the modal that appears, enter your Jira **Project Key** (e.g., `BUSINT`, `PROJ`).
3.  Click **Save & Close**. The dashboard will automatically fetch your assigned tasks from that project.
